# User Authentication

There are many ways to provide authentication for users in your application.
Often, sites require a username and password, but others allow you to login
with another account, such as Facebook or Google. Sometimes websites include
two-factor authentication, such as with an extra application like Duo or a
physical device like a YubiKey.

There is also a lot of bad advice on the web about authentication. Getting
authentication right is hard and many people make mistakes.

This tutorial will cover a few of the basics so that you have a solid foundation
for authenticating users in a web application.
